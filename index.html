            There are so many layers to domestic violence. And not just financial, although those are valid. But we are talking about human hearts. It’s not easy to leave someone you love. It’s not easy to leave when you have nowhere to go. It’s not easy to leave when you are threatened. It’s not easy to leave when you remember how it used to be, or when they romance you during the good times, or when they promise it is the last time. Because you believe in love and you believe in them.

                It is about time we stop victim-blaming and stand up. <br>
                Stand up for the victims of abuse.<br> 
                Why are they questioned on "not leaving the relationship?", 
                Why is the abuser not questioned?<br>
                The narrative has to change as soon as possible. This is the only way there can be any change. <br><br>
